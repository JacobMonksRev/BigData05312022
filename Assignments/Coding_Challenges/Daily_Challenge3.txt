Write a Python function that takes an input integer 'n' and does the following:
- Determine if 'n' is a prime number (only divisible by itself and 1)
- If 'n' is a prime number, print "Prime".
- If 'n' is a composite number, print "Composite"

Ex1. n = 23
23 is divisible by 1 and 23 only => 23 is prime.

Ex2. n = 24
24 is divisible by 1,2,3,4,6,8,12, and 24 => 24 is composite.

def isPrime(n):
...     if n == 1:
...             print("Your number is neither prime nor ecomposite.")
...     elif n > 1:
...             for i in range(2, n):
...                     if n%i == 0:
...                             print("This number is composite")
...                             return
...             print("This number is Prime.")
