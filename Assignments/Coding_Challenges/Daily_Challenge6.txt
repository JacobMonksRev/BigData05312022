Write a python function that takes in a list of numbers and creates a dictionary where the keys are
each number that exists in the list, and the values are how many times that number appears in the list.

Ex.
input: lst = [1,4,2,1,2,3]
output: dict = {1:2 , 2:2 , 3:1 , 4:1}

Solution 1:

def fun(list):
	dict = {}
	for i in list:
		dict[i] = list.count(i)
	return dict

Solution 2:

from collections import Counter

def fun2(list):
	return Counter(list)

Solution 3:

def fun3(list):
	dict = {}
	dictval = 0
	for i in list:
		for j in list:
			if i == j:
				dictval += 1
		dict.update({i:dictval})
		dictval = 0
	return dict
