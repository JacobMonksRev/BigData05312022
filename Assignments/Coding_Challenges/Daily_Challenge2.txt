We have 2 tables with the following schema:

    Employees                       Departments
Fields     | DataTypes          Fields  | DataTypes
-----------+-----------        ---------+-----------
Emp_ID     | INT                Dept_ID | INT
FirstName  | VARCHAR(255)       Name    | VARCHAR(255)
LastName   | VARCHAR(255)
Dept_ID    | INT

Using SQL, how do we output each person's first and last name and the department they work for?
The output should be displayed in alphabetical order by first name, then by last name.

Solution:

SELECT Employees.Firstname, Employees.Lastname, Departments.Name
FROM Employees JOIN Departments
ON Employees.Dept_ID = Departments.Dept_ID
ORDER BY Firstname, Lastname
