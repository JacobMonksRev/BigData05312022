Technology Project Presentation Guidelines:

- Be sure that every member introduces themselves.
- Have a slideshow to briefly cover some project info:
    1. What is your project? Give your project a name.
    2. What is the goal of your project?
    3. Tech stack
    4. Mention if / where you obtained any public data.
    5. How you answered the marketing questions.
    6. Are there any other interesting features of your project?
    7. Any changes / improvements you would make if given more time.

- Make sure to have visuals ready, in the slideshow or separately.
- Each person in the group should speak for a roughly equal amount of time.
- Presentations should be no longer than 20 minutes per group (aim for 15).
