- Be sure that every member introduces themselves.
- Have a slideshow to briefly cover some project info:
    1. What is your project?
    2. Tech stack
    3. Mention if / where you obtained any public data.
    4. How you answered the marketing questions.

- Make sure to have visuals ready.
- Each person in the group should speak for a roughly equal amount of time.
- Presentations should be no longer than 10 minutes per group.
