Technology Project Milestone:

This is a sort of checkpoint for your project.
The goal is to review your progress up to this point and determine how far you have come in achieving the project goals.

Short 5-minute presentation:
	- Briefly go over the project requirements.
	- Introduce what your project is (not too much detail).
	- Break down the items that have been completed.
	- Discuss items that are being worked on.
	- Discuss items that need to be started.
	- Go over every team member's contribution and PLANNED contribution.

The purpose of this is to do a brief retrospective on how well you have been following the guidelines set by this project.
If you find you have not been meeting the guidelines, this is your chance to fix it.
