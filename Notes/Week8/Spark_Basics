WHAT IS SPARK?

Spark is an open-source data processing engine.
It is a software utility of Hadoop.
It splits tasks acoss multiple nodes ina Cluster to perform parallel processing.
Spark uses RAM to process and cache data instead of the file system.
- this allows for faster access.
- memory is voltaile and not saved when the application stops.

RDD - Resilient Distributed Dataset
- if the system crashes, the RDD will be maintained.
- RDD itself does not store any data.
    - the RDD has the information that is necssary for recreating the data.
    - an RDD Lineage refers to the steps taken in order to create the specific RDD.
    - lineage can be found using method .toDebugString

- Creating an RDD:
    1. parallelize an existing collection.
    2. transform another rdd.
    3. use a textfile (of format csv).
        rdd3 = sc.textFile('/path/textfile.txt')
    4. Use an existing dataframe or dataset.
